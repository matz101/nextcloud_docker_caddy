# Setup of Nextcloud with Docker behind Caddy reverse proxy

Basic setup first. An extension with Collabora and Elasticsearch is described below.
Note: This is the result of my own journey. It may not be optimized, it works for me and comes with no guarantees. 
I'm writing this up, because I found it surprisingly difficult to find descriptions on the web how to do a proper Nextcloud with Docker setup. Maybe it's of help to anyone. 



## Basic setup with MariaDB, Nginx, Redis


## Extended with Redis, Collabora, Elasticsearch
